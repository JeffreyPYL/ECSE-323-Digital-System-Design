# ECSE-323-Digital-System-Design
This class is about Minimization and synthesis of combinational logic and finite state machines.Synthesis of synchronous and asynchronous sequential circuits. Principles of control design. Basic concepts in design for testability. Laboratory experiments involve the design and testing of FPGA based digital systems using CAD software and hardware description languages. 
And through different labs, I gradually build/code the circuit for a electrical music box.
